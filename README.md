# An AI Based Integrated Framework for Motion Activated Facial Recognition
Project Overview
The AI Based Integrated Framework for Motion Activated Facial Recognition is an innovative solution aimed at improving road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness and impairment in drivers. This project leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, along with facial recognition and sentiment analysis techniques, to monitor and analyze the facial expressions and movements of drivers in real-time. The primary objective is to identify early signs of fatigue or impairment and provide timely alerts to prevent accidents.

Key Features
Motion Activation: The system activates automatically upon detecting motion, ensuring continuous monitoring while driving.
Facial Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time facial recognition to identify and track the driver's face.
Drowsiness Detection: Analyzes facial expressions to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, yawning, and head nodding.
Soberness Detection: Implements sentiment analysis to assess the emotional state of the driver, identifying potential signs of impairment.
Real-time Alerts: Provides immediate feedback and alerts when signs of drowsiness or impairment are detected.
Technical Tools Used
Python: The core programming language used for implementing the framework.
OpenCV: A powerful library used for real-time computer vision, particularly for facial recognition and motion detection.
Sentiment Analysis: Employed to evaluate the emotional state of the driver and detect signs of impairment.

Usage
System Activation: The system activates upon detecting motion within the camera's field of view. Ensure that the camera is properly positioned to capture the driver's face.

Real-time Monitoring: Once activated, the system will continuously monitor the driver's facial expressions and movements, analyzing them for signs of drowsiness or impairment.

Alerts: If the system detects potential drowsiness or impairment, it will trigger an alert. This could be an audible alarm or a visual warning, depending on your implementation.
