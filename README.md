# An AI Based Integrated Framework for Motion Activated Facial Recognition
The "AI Based Integrated Framework for Motion Activated Facial Recognition" is a cutting-edge technology designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness and soberness during driving. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, this framework analyzes facial expressions and movements to identify signs of fatigue or impairment.
